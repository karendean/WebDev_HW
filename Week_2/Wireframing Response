Lissa Aguilar’s article on wireframing was rather insightful as it presented information regarding UX design in a detailed and concise way. She places an emphasis on truly understanding the client and their problem prior to wireframing, as this will prove to be more time efficient in the long run as well as necessary to the success of the overall website design. Part of this understanding can be achieved through interviewing the client, sketching with them, and getting feedback as soon as possible. Equally important to grasping the scope of the project is using the correct wireframing tools, which can be tailored similarly to the client’s needs. These factors ensure a well-informed solution, as being more familiar with the client’s needs and their audience focuses the project’s important goals.
